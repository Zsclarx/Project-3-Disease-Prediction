# Disease Prediction from Symptoms

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms. 

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. Decision Tree

# Dataset


### Source-1
The dataset for this problem used with the Jupyter notebook is downloaded from here: 
```
https://impact.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html
```

This dataset has 3 columns:
```
Disease  | Count of Disease Occurrence | Symptom
```

You can either copy paste the whole table from here to an excel sheet or scrape it out using Beautifulsoup.


# Usage

Please make sure to install all dependencies before running the demo, using the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**NOTE:** ***This project is for demo purposes only. For any symptoms/disease, please refer to a Doctor.***
